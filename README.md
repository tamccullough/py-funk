## py-funk is a work in progress

I am new to Machine Learning, and what I have found during my short journey is that there is a vast array of content on the subject matter. And this vast amount of content can be quite overwhelming to the newcomer.

I want to help share what little knowledge I have gained with others.

[Google Doc - PYTHON ML FUNCTIONS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10mKYnh93mSuzzjq6iB1cJ7GW7qsHg7ZSENQIKJS5EDk/edit?usp=sharing)

Loading up and searching through notebooks can be a little tedious when you just want to find some simple code item you had written during a project at some point.

So, to avoid doing that, the above link points to a google doc I have shared in my drive. I feel like this is a faster way to access code I have written - relating to functions - that can speed up my own process of writing new code.

It may help you too.

I will add more notebooks as time goes by, and edit all of them as I see fit, to make them as helpful and as easy to use as possible.
